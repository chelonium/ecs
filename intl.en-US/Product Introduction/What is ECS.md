# What is ECS {#concept_rhf_xgv_tdb .concept}

In this document, you can learn what an Ali cloud server is, and the resources and services that it involves.

Elastic Compute Service \(ECS\) is a type of computing service that features elastic processing capabilities. ECS has a simpler and more efficient management mode than physical servers. You can create instances, change the operating system, and add or release any number of ECS instances at any time to fit your business needs. During use, as the business expands, you can expand your disk and increase your bandwidth at any time. If you no longer need a cloud server, you can also release resources at any time and save on costs.

The following figure illustrates the concept of an ECS instance. You can use the [ECS console](https://ecs.console.aliyun.com/#/home) to configure the instance type, disks, operating system, and other affiliated resources for your ECS instance.

## Basic concepts {#section_jkn_4qj_ydb .section}

Know the basic concepts before you proceed to use ECS:

-   [Regions and zones](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/doc-detail/40654.htm): A physical location where a data center is located.
-   [Instance](intl.en-US/Product Introduction/Instance.md#): A virtual computing environment that includes CPU, memory, operating system, bandwidth, disks, and other basic computing components.
-   [Instance type](intl.en-US/Product Introduction/Instance type families.md#): The specification of an ECS instance, including the number of vCPU cores, memory, networking performance. An instance type determines the compute capability of an ECS instance.
-   [Images](intl.en-US/Product Introduction/Images.md#): A running environment template for ECS instances. It generally includes an operating system and preinstalled software. The operating system supports multiple Linux verions and various Windows versions.
-   [Block storage](intl.en-US/Product Introduction/Block storage.md#): Block level storage products for your ECS, including elastic block storage based on the distributed storage architecture and local disks located on the physical server that an ECS instance is hosted on.
-   [Snapshots](intl.en-US/Product Introduction/Snapshots.md#): A copy of data on an elastic block storage device at a given time point.
-   [Network types](intl.en-US/Product Introduction/Network & Security/Network types.md#): Alibaba Cloud provides two network types, including
    -   Virtual Private Cloud \(VPC\): A private network established in Alibaba Cloud. VPCs are logically isolated from other virtual networks in Alibaba Cloud. For more information, see What is [VPC](../../intl.en-US/VPC product introduction/What is VPC.md#).
    -   Classic network: A network majorly deployed in the public infrastructure of Alibaba Cloud.
-   [Security groups](intl.en-US/Product Introduction/Network & Security/Security groups.md#): A logical group that groups instances in the same region with the same security requirements and mutual trust. A security group works as a virtual firewall for the ECS instances inside it.
-   [SSH key pairs](intl.en-US/Product Introduction/Network & Security/SSH key pairs.md#): A secure authentication method to remotely log on to Linux instances. The public key is placed in a Linux instance, and you can use the private key to log on to the instance by using SSH commands or related tools. Besides, you can use a [password](../intl.en-US/User Guide/Connect/Connect to a Linux instance by using a password.md#) to log on to a Linux instance.
-   IP address: When an ECS instance is created, a private IP address is assigned to it for [intranet communication](intl.en-US/Product Introduction/Network & Security/Intranet.md#). If the instance needs Internet access, a public IP address is assigned.
-   [EIP address \(EIP\)](https://help.aliyun.com/product/61789.html): A public IP address resource that you can purchase and possess independently. You can bind an EIP address to a VPC-Connected ECS instance.
-   [ECS console](https://ecs.console.aliyun.com/#/home): The Web application for managing ECS instances.
